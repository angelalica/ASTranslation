Description: This package serves as an analytical pipeline for determining
    allele-specific translation. It first identifies genetic variants that are
    candidates for allele-specific translation (i.e. may lead to differential
    translation) by using RNA-Seq and Ribosome profiling data from all
    heterozygous SNPs in the transcriptome of a given individual. For each
    candidate SNP, a separate function determines whether the SNP does have
    allele-specific translation, using data from an experimental assay that
    combines polysome profiling and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), which gives
    the distribution of number of ribosomes bound to the two alleles.
