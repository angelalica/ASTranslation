Description: This package helps the user assess whether a gene in a particular
    heterozygous individual has allele-specific translation based on data from an
    assay that combines polysome profiling and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). It uses
    bootstrapping techniques to determine whether the amount of mutant and wildtype
    transcripts in each fraction (either directly from the polysome profiling or
    grouped by number of ribosomes) is significantly different from the expected
    values. Each fraction corresponds to a particular weight (heavier transcripts
    contain a greater number of ribosomes, indicating greater translation).
